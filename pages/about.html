            <h3>Our Story</h3>
           
            <pre >
                Bliss Café was born from a simple yet heartfelt dream  to create a space that felt like home. 
                What started as a small idea quickly blossomed into a vision: a cozy, 
                welcoming café where people could escape the rush of daily life, slow down, 
                and enjoy the beauty of the present moment. 
                Inspired by the belief that joy is found in simplicity a warm drink, 
                a meaningful conversation, a quiet moment alone.
                Bliss Café was thoughtfully designed to offer more than just coffee and food. 
                It became a space for connection, creativity, and community. 
                From its humble beginnings, the café has grown, 
                but its heart remains the same: to serve with warmth, intention, and love."

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <pre>

                At Bliss Café, our mission is to cultivate a space that nurtures both body and soul. We strive to offer thoughtfully crafted food and drinks made with fresh, 
                wholesome ingredients, served in an environment that encourages pause, presence, and peace. 
                More than just a café, we are a community hub, a place where people feel seen, heard, and valued. 
                Every cup, every smile, and every moment shared at Bliss is part of our deeper purpose: to inspire mindfulness, spark joy, 
                and remind people to find beauty in the little things.
